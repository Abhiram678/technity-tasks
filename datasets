Lab 1 (Basics, Cropping, Flipping) & Lab 2 (Rotation, Scaling, Translation)

General image dataset: Any standard test images like Lena, cameraman, or sample images from datasets like:

USC-SIPI Image Database: Contains standard test images
Your own photographs or sample images



Lab 3 (Face & Object Detection)

Face and Eye Detection:

Yale Face Database or CMU Frontal Faces: For testing on static images
LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild): For more varied face detection tests
You'll also need the Haar cascade XML files from OpenCV (pre-trained models)


Car and Pedestrian Detection:

UIUC Image DB: For car detection
Caltech Pedestrian Dataset: For pedestrian detection
COCO: Contains both cars and pedestrians for combined testing



Lab 4 (Face and Eye Alignment)

CMU Multi-PIE Database or CelebA: For faces with varied poses
HELEN Dataset: Has detailed facial landmark annotations
You can also use the 300-W dataset which is specifically designed for facial landmark detection tasks

Lab 5 (Edge Detection using CNN)

BSDS500 (Berkeley Segmentation Dataset): The standard dataset for edge detection evaluation
NYU Depth Dataset: If you want to experiment with RGB-D edge detection

Lab 6 (Feature Detection and Mapping)

Oxford Buildings Dataset: Good for feature matching across viewpoints
DTU Robot Image Dataset: Contains multiple viewpoints of objects
KITTI Dataset: For feature detection and matching in real-world scenes

Lab 7 (Object Counter)

PETS Dataset: For counting people in surveillance settings
CARPK Dataset: Specifically designed for counting cars in parking lots
Mall Dataset: For crowd counting
TRANCOS Dataset: For vehicle counting

Lab 8 (Bag of Words)

Caltech-101 or Caltech-256: Standard datasets for object recognition using BoW
15 Scenes Dataset: For scene classification
PASCAL VOC: More challenging multi-object dataset
